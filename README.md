**Bring your ideas to life.**

Create fully interactive and native iOS apps without writing a single line of code. Simply import your creative assets into PencilCase: Studio and use the built-in tools to add the functionality you would expect to see in an app like behaviors, gestures, transitions and animations. With no templates to be restricted to, you have complete creative control.

## Migrating

If you were using the paid version of PencilCase the only difference you will notice when migrating to the open source version is that you can no longer share your apps to the PencilCase player. Instead we recommend exporting your creations to Xcode and distributing through the standard channels Apple provides for app distribution. [Get started here.](https://developer.apple.com)
