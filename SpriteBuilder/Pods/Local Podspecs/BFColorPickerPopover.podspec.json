  "description": "BFColorPickerPopover is a subclass of NSPopover that includes the standard OS X color\npicker user interface. This helps reducing the inspector window and panel clutter on \nthe screen, as the popover sticks to the content it belongs to. However it's still \npossible to transform it into an inspector style floating panel by simple dragging \nit off from the color well.",
